# Adds column family names as tags and removes them from the metric name.
# This was written for use with the FastJMX Collectd plugin that reads JMX metrics from Cassandra.
# NOTE: The code looks for "column_family" as the plugin name and replaces it with "cassandra". In the FastJMX configuration a value can have a "PluginName" property
# which is set to "cassandra" for all metrics except those that have metrics for all column families. These I set to "column_family" as a way to easily
#       identify metrics that this plugin will modify.
# class Formatter:

# For column families, remove plugin_instance from name and change plugin name to "cassandra" and add column_families as a tag
